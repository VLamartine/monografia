            <h1>About this site</h1>
            <p>The purpose of this site is to make available a random draw tool, transparent and verifiable. Our draw
                method, described below, guarantees that, for the same input (seed + items in the same order), the
                result will always be the same.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>The user enters which seed origin they desire
                    <br>
                    If the origin is one of the available randomness beacons, the seed can be:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The last pulse (Default)</li>
                        <li>The next pulse</li>
                        <li>A pulse from a specific time from the past</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The User enters the items that they want ordered, one per line, with its weight</li>
                <li>Each item gets a chance that is equal to its weight divided by the total sum of the weight. With 4
                    decimal places</li>
                <li>Each item is placed in an interval from 0 to 100, and gets a subinterval equal to its chance</li>
                <li>The seed is divided by 2^512, and the item that has the result in its interval is the winner</li>
            </ol>
